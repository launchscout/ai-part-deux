[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.020]   Okay. So let's take it from the top. When when was the first time that you ever used a A_I_ assisted coding helper? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:24.460]   Who told me it was like two years ago because I had lunch with this guy and at that point he was like all in on GitHub co-pilot and he was like this is the future I'm using it for everything it's so great and at the time my experience was like totally the opposite of that I. had tried it multiple times, each time it would occasionally generate something great which was just enough to pull me in and get me to [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:41.820]   mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. And and this was [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.440]   Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:02:06.840]   he so we got together f f like really recently and he reminded me of that and at the time he was like yeah man I just think Chris is wrong about this and sure enough two years later he was right I was wrong like no question. Um I front Mike Ball. You know Mike, yeah. Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   This is like twenty two twenty three? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:23.740]   Yeah um I'd I'd have to go back in my email and look, but like I just had lunch with him recently and so it was if it was two years ago it woulda been twenty two. And uh so some time in there. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:56.460]   Well is that I was of course I wasn't coding heavily but my impression was that the in fact I said these words out loud, the amount of time it took to review the code that it wrote was more than the amount of time it would take me to write the code to begin with. So like I was faster than using it to generate code and then P_R_ review it. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.540]   Yep.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:12.180]   Okay so that's twenty two twenty three time frame and y we used looked at it Lucy, and Charlie Brown, and then w where does it where does the story pick up from there? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:27.440]   I think it was at the beginning of this year twenty [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   five that Tim had some experience I. don't know when I first started hearing about cursor, but Tim Tim was the first one to convince me to actually give it a real try. Um [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:57.420]   Well hang on a second. We were like right before Christmas, the three of us were hanging out in the office like that week before Christmas break. And and that's when you like [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.040]   R_I_V_ coded Paramount landscaping That. was before Christmas. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:23.940]   Tim was having uh reporting success with using cursor for real work. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.840]   October, November, December. He was on Beyond Will. And they were using it like crazy. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:40.920]   And I didn't re okay. So it's longer ago than that. So um he convinced me to give it a try and
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:49.840]   I think even then my first attempt with it was like meh. This is just like [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.240]   I remember you had a couple false starts in there trying things. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.500]   annoying noise, and I don't wanna deal with it. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:10.940]   Do you remember what you were doing at that time that's different than what you did with Paramount? Like the b the first big success story was Paramount landscaping in my mind of you basically live coding this work order management system in a couple days. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:39.760]   But I'm gonna go back a little bit 'cause I re I remembered a thing that I tried. Before I got to cursor, I think I tried something with AIDR. Yeah. And AIDR is another A_I_ tool that's fairly it's open source. It's command line to uh terminal driven. And it can both, you know, generate code, but also like interact with the command line. So agent type stuff. Um [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:53.340]   and uh in his last name I could never remember uh but he's from Six Feet Up. He loves AIDR. He loves it more than cursor. He did this whole like testing all these different tools and he's like I pick you AIDR. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:24.240]   Yeah, I watched some of that that video. That was that was pretty good Anyway. So I tried AIDR and I think what I was doing was I was um I had this little side project to try to form um like groups of people that wanna groups of pilots that wanna share an airplane that wanna go on on an airplane to work. Um never really got to think all the way to production, but I keep trying little experiments to do it. So this was one, and I think what I was doing [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:54.420]   was I believe I was probably taking like um a C_S_V_ file of airport information from the F_A_A_ and trying to bring it into an Elixir app. And as I recall like it did a pretty good job with that. Like I told it to do it um and it did a decent job and then I think what happened was I kept going with it and at some point it just
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:09.460]   it like doing worse and worse. It started just like m making mistakes or making things too complicated and after a while it was like they couldn't figure out all the complicated mess that it had made. And I was just like ah stop. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:24.700]   When the code base is green and fresh, it can make pretty good approximations, but the more complicated the code gets, the harder it it navigates it. Or what do you think happened? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:55.260]   So what I th remember, and it's been a little while and my memory is sketchy as we've already established, um what I remember is when I tried cursor again at Tim's uh prompting, no pun intended, um the thing that I remember is like cursor had just come out with this uh they didn't call it agent mode, they called it
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:22.000]   else. It was like composer and chat, they had like these two different modes and chat was just like generating code, but the composer could do stuff and then react to it. And I think it was in composer, was the first time that I was able to get it to run tests, see the test results, and then go back and fix the code accordingly. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.600]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:35.540]   the the most significant event that I can think of in my journey with the A_I_ assisted coding. That's what yep, [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.780]   I should have written that date down. That's like that should be in history somewhere. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:28.680]   Yeah, I wonder if it's in your git commit log somewhere. But you could back it up and figure it out. I do want to dive into the Paramount landscaping story and get really get your like how did your mind shift when you started that project or like well the cont the way that I tell this story is that Joe, who owns this landscaping company, has his own custom work order sheet that he called a white sheet. And he was doing them by [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:47.560]   and everybody hated it Like. universally everyone at his company hated this, including himself, but he couldn't tear himself apart from it. And he's like I want some software to do this. And he's like a million two million dollar business. It doesn't really not big but not big enough to like be in the custom software business. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.400]   Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Yeah so we spent two three four sessions of him coming into the office and or calling him and talking to him trying to talk him out of building custom software and saying why don't you use this other tool that you already are paying for, why don't you use um uh Aspire which we have some affiliation with, why don't you use this, why don't you use that and we kept looking at all these different tools and he was like no these tools just weren't
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   quite right. They didn't work exactly the way that he wanted 'em to. They were either too complicated or not targeted enough. He wanted something simple that was right on point for what he had. And what I remember is at one point, this was about the time that Tim was like coming in g you know waving his hands going, you won't believe what I've done. I'm beyond will and I've done these incredible things and this is amazing. And we just said well let's just try it. We ha we gotta copy the P_D_F_ from Joe
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.060]   and you just started coding it. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:59.320]   Yeah, I I think the original idea was
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:07.540]   what we used to do in our discovery process was like let's see if we could come up with
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:37.120]   you know, just a prototype of what the app that you need would look like. And it was usually like in Figma. It might not even be that much, it might even be just like user stories of what the app should do, but ideally if we had enough time we'd like have wire frames right, And. yeah, yeah. And I think the ideas I remembered on Paramount Landscaping was like what if instead of doing that we like [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.680]   Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:12:06.420]   use cursor, this was before anybody had the word vibe coding, but this is essentially the idea. What if we could like just lean on A_I_ to the great ext extent possible to actually come up come up with a full working app that we deployed somewhere, so that we could show it to Joe and go like is this what you have in mind? And he could actually interact with it. And that's great Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:17.100]   And we said can we get something running, and by we I mean you. I was just encouraging you I. wasn't doing anything, but can we get something running that we can demo that actually works. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.600]   Right Right. And. I think
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:32.060]   we had somewhere like a really small number of a really small amount of time that we wanted to use to try this out. I think it was like day or two and I don't know when to say ten hours or something. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:57.180]   Yeah. The the way that I tell the story is that it was total including the sales time about twenty five hours worth of conversations and coding. And you'd coded it I. remember pretty distinctly it was over about two calendar days and you put about you know twelve sixteen, hours maybe maybe a little bit more than that into the coding effort. But it was really two calendar days. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.080]   To fly.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.200]   Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.640]   And w went and showed 'em and they said that's great. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:22.040]   Yeah. Yeah and it was yeah and he was really excited about it and he was excited about how how simple it was um and then yeah we started we started rolling from there. I don't know about that. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.540]   Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:44.000]   What did you 'cause you were kind of just doing it on your own and just sitting there trying to like play with things and it was maybe your first real use of cursor. And and how did you like how did you shift your head? Did you do test driven development? Like how did you get cursor to actually write the code that you wanted? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.660]   Um
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:14:19.260]   I definitely was having it write and run tests as it was building the code. Um I remember that I was definitely trying to get it to do test driven development, write the tests first, but I think at some point I realised well it's not an actual like it's not gonna benefit from tests and it's design thinking process the way a human was 'cause it's not really you know that's not really [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.680]   informing the decision. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:50.680]   it's not really informing the decisions that it makes. So it doesn't really matter whether the test is before the code or not, I don't think. But definitely like seeing it it w it would consistently, you know, generate a first version of the code. It would be not right in some way. And it would generate the tests and run the tests and and then it could use that process to give itself
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:15:19.940]   its own feedback to get the code to actually make the test pass. And then I could say things like hey this part of the code is terrible or way too complicated or yeah I remember it do it would do things like you know and this was like several models ago now right, This. was like three five and we've had two major model increases it model releases since then. I'm talking about Claude here. Um [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:38.520]   And at that time you know a lot of the code it would write as wasn't very good. Like it would do things like here right in the middle of this view in this H_T_M_L_ template I think I'll just like do a crazy amount of code and query the database directly. Or you know do stuff that we would never do. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:16:03.040]   it like okay don't do that that's, no good I need you to move the code over here and it could do that it, would make mistakes but, it could then run the tests and go like oh I'm sorry and then fix the mistake. And that that again that's why that milestone was so important is like it could self-correct. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:35.760]   and Live View? Um yeah, so what I I did some vibe coding with Elixir. What I found was that it wanted to write it more object-oriented like, more it wanted to do a like a lot of conditional logic and kinda traditional kind of stuff and every time it would do something I'd say no, can't you do that with pattern matching? And it would say oh, you're right, I can do thi this way. So it would write the code and when you told it [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:47.900]   you wanted, it would um it would be like oh yeah, this is more id idiomatic of Elixir to do it this way, I'll do it this way. But you constantly had to remind it what idi what you were looking for. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:17:05.740]   And at some point, you know, I think even though they had cursor rules and at some point I wrote a document for it about like this is how to do test-driven development and, you know, I'd refer to that document and sometimes it would pay attention to that for a little while and then eventually [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:05.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:17.960]   go off and decide I wanted to do something different. Like a person would like a like a young developer would be like uh yeah, I know you said tests are a good idea, but uh I think I'm gonna do this. Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:47.980]   I I do think that in my own experience really doing test first mattered to cursor Not. that it was learning, you know it, was informing the design, but getting the test right before like part of the whole my whole experience of vibe coding is trying to get cursor to not get too far ahead, not get it to run away and just like vomit code into the editor. And so like what are the techniques we can use to rein in how much code it
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:18:17.920]   And for me, getting the test exactly right and and and you know explicitly prompting it, don't go write the code. We're just gonna write the test. We're doing test driven development. I wanna make sure the test are exactly right before we do that. Then that ga establish guard rails for when it starts vomiting code, it says it can be contained by the test don't ask for this, the test don't tell you to do this. You're you know you're off your rocker s skip back [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:37.340]   on the reservation type thing. So when you we delivered Paramount then, and the follow-up to that was that we had a small contract that was a few hours a month that you just kinda go back with them. And they used that version in production wh while they modified it to [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:46.640]   Are they using it day to day like out in the field? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:19:16.160]   they're not they what they decided to do was uh uh about the midway through the project we had this giant s no storm in Cincinnati and um that they were doing the same white sheets but like originally we started looking at the w these sheets of paper that they're using to track landscaping projects but, they're also using a different sheet of paper to track snow removal and what happened is they had this huge storm and it took them weeks to just type in [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:42.220]   sheets of paper into their Excel s giant Excel spreadsheet they're using to track everything. And uh and that became like very much top of mind. And so actually we've been working on that. Because it's not snow season we have this thing done, but they're probably not gonna go to production with the snow removal until they have snow to remove again because, it's j May. Anyway. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   That continues to go on. Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.260]   Is is that in are people using it every day? Or are they just like fiddling with it? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:57.980]   Uh they're n they're not using it every day because yeah, we're not in the right season yet. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.660]   Even for lawn care stuff? I thought this would be busy season for lo for landscaping and lawn care. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:33.160]   It would be. But what they decided to do is like we wanna finish all of snow removal and then worry about landscaping. So that's the decision that they made for right or wrong. I don't know if it was the right or wrong decisions. But so at this point I think we have snow removal kinda done and I'm just actually just waiting for feedback on them. I probably need to pester them about that and say like hey, was this good? What do you wanna do next? Uh but it's been a continuous process of like every so often I'll go back and you know, [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:45.820]   lean-on cursor to do a little bit more. And I'll generally do a good job with very s few specific things where I will always make a mess. And it just [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:21:12.480]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.700]   That's a messy situation in any language. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   it is, but in live view it's particularly there's a way to do it, which is actually like you know once, you do it, the code is like it it works really well and it's not a lot of code, but it's not in my opinion very intuitive. And although that's my opinion, what's interesting is that cursor will always make a mess of it. Because if it's not intuitive to me as a human, it's also not intuitive to cursor. Um so
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:22:14.820]   time I asked it to do one of those things, I know it's just gonna be a train wreck. But what I did was if I did one myself first, and I said do it like this one over here, then it will be able to do it. And then essentially one shot it. So that taught me that like the two things that seem to be most important are tests and examples And. honestly like uh I I am rooting for you. I love the idea of giving [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.160]   is there a good documentation for it to read about how to do something in practice?
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:34.760]   Meh. I mean I'm still hoping for that to get better. It it is with the models improving. Like it is actually the cursor four might be better at it. But undoubtedly examples work better than documentation. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:43.800]   So the the concept that you're referring to is we've talked internally about doing like A_D_R_ driven A_I_, where A_D_R_ is um [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.040]   That b uh architecture design rec decision architecture decision record I think. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:23:18.340]   Yes architecture, decision record is an A_D_R_. It's a specific format that Microsoft invented that says here's the thing that we're doing and here's our policy and here's why and here's the other things that we considered and here's the outcomes that we expect to happen. And you put these documents in a folder somewhere and that's magically makes all your developers smarter. They don't have to like revisit these things over and over again. We had the idea that we could help a co like nobody really wants to write these 'cause it's like an feels like an exercise in busy work. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:18.700]   Sure.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.140]   Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.940]   Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:24:02.080]   But I think that there's a theme here of the things that we think might be a good idea to do that are tedious, are actually helpful for the A_I_ and whether it's documentation, whether it's um you know so the idea was that if we had all the A_D_R_s properly written and we could actually use A_I_ to write the A_D_R_s, then we could use that as a framework for the A_I_ bot to stay in the guard rails. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.380]   Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:46.500]   Is the b a better way to to guide it. I think that there's a pattern here of saying if we do the things that we've said are good to do, they're also good for the A_I_ assistance. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:25:16.520]   The yeah, tha that was the other thing that happened that, was a real light bulb moment somewhere along the way probably around paramount it was. Um yeah, the th that the things we've always valued about like what are the practices that make us good developers. Like if you I always think about that Kent Beck Kent Beck quote that you know I'd rather have like a good programmer
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:27.180]   with excellent habits and practices than, you know, the smartest developer in the world. And that's not the c that quote I'm butchering it. But the uh it's the idea. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:26:12.600]   Yeah. Yeah. But the the general thing that made me I I think more excited about trying to embrace I_ A_I_ is like the things that I uh uh the things that we value about doing software development well still matter. And that may be I think I c I came to A_I_ thinking well if A_I_ is gonna write all the code, all of a sudden nothing matters any more [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.720]   good code. Because the A_I_ is doing it. So who cares? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:36.620]   If it's so if if the code is that easy to write, if it if it works, who cares if it's good or not. And I've seen that argument before too, like it didn't cost me anything to write this bad code. So if it's wrong, I'll just have A_I_ rewrite it again and it'll be right the next time. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.320]   So how did you come to the conclusion that that was like a fallacy? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:27:07.340]   Mm-hmm.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:22.280]   Mm-hmm.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.720]   Mm-hmm.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:41.180]   You you think that's
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:57.020]   I think Ruby's better at that. Ruby is almost like writing code. I remember learning Ruby and thinking I don't know how to write this, but if I did, I would write it like this and then it would work. Elixir's c not quite like that, but it it can be. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:15.960]   So and I haven't before we started using it with the looks or Tim was using it with Ruby and it was doing an amazing job. And um I actually saw a talk about this at RubyConf where the basic argument was like
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:42.420]   hallucinations are a feature of A_I_ they're not a bug. And so it's gonna make stuff up. What if we could build our systems such that like you can guess and make stuff up and be write more of the time. And guess what, Ruby is an amazing programming language for doing that because it kind of like works that way already. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:56.020]   I yeah, that's hard for me to get behind just because I really like Elixir. But I mean I see what like there's a point there for sure. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:17.220]   Uh the I think one, the opus of object-oriented programming is much higher than the opus of functional programming that the L_L_M_s are learning from. And two, the language is m I think tighter and and more concise and it's easier to make D_S_L_s in Ruby. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:52.180]   Ruby, I think as a language, yeah, I I think it's still the best at I can easily express this problem in the minimum amount of like really frankly beautiful, easy to read and understand code. I don't know that there's any other language that's as good as Ruby. But but I wanna say it it I I've seen enough Python that I'm still absolutely gonna g give it to the nod on that to [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.280]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   But I will say I think the object-oriented versus functional is really important to think about. And the reason that I think functional has an edge is because of the context. So if you're looking at a functional language, if you all if you're building a function, you know the entire context, because it's the parameters coming in and the value of
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:53.360]   returned. And yeah, maybe you can go out and do side effect stuff. But it's not like an object where you can have like con things that like spider out infinitely that you the object graph. You don't have the object graph which could be infinitely deep and affect your code in ways that you have to understand. Like in you're in the middle of a method and you could do
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:31:23.300]   and it could like affect something six layers out on the object graph. And that's like a tremendous amount of context, especially if you like don't design your object oriented systems really really really well, which is really really really hard as you know. And so that's why I think a functional language I think, you know, for the same reason that like I've seen brand new apprentices take to functional [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:39.720]   programming really really well and come back and tell me like you know if they started with Elixir and then had to do Ruby, it was it was a struggle boss because they're used to just like okay I know everything just from this function because you know a function's a function. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:32:10.080]   and functions call other functions and so there's like a certain amount of like a call chain, but because the functions don't have side effects per se, the context is still more bounded than in in in in uh a normal object graph programming language kind of thing. Yeah, you're right about that. That's a good point. So I wanna go back and let's part of what I want us to do today is to survey the projects that you've worked on in with A_I_ and how they're the same and how [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:38.260]   the different So. that paramount landscaping you did was in like February, March, April, and now we're at the end of May. And so you've done I think a total of like maybe fifty five, sixty hours on p on this project, which is a ridiculously small number of hours for what you've accomplished. What is the next project after you s delivered the first like bit for paramount that you did with A_I_ assisted coding? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:58.620]   was A_ and P_. And they had they had been like Tim had been talking to them about what we were trying and doing and they said like hey we want in on this. And they I d yeah. Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:13.600]   we were going to some of our clients that that trusted us that we trusted them and saying we wanna do A_I_ exp experiments. We think we can develop code really fast. We wanna see what we can accomplish for you in a bounded time frame. And A_ and P_ stepped up. I forgot. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:43.480]   Yeah. Yeah. And they came to us with um the specific s experiment identified. And it was also a spreadsheet they were using to track stuff that they wanted to replace with a web app. And there's so many of those out in the world Oh. my gosh. Um so and they I think it was two weeks They. identified like a time box, a thing that they wanted to do. Um [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:53.400]   it was certainly more substantial than um the early versions of Paramount, although Paramount's grown in complexity, that's a whole other story. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:34:04.180]   Well I think it was more complex than what we originally guessed. Like they told us we wanna do this thing and Tim's like yeah we can do it in two weeks. And then he saw the spreadsheet and he was like whoa. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:38.680]   Um we did it with just me as the developer on for eighty hours. Maybe from last but it two weeks. Um we also had a designer uh Katie Pullman on at half time. Yes. Uh and and we had this this spreadsheet and it was also like a well n there were software packages. It was a calibration system. There were other off the shelf
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:35:08.160]   software practices that you could buy as a calibration system. They're pretty expensive blah blah blah Um. they were doing essentially the equivalent of tracking the calibration of their equipment in a spreadsheet and our goal was to build a calibration system to replace that spreadsheet and then some. Uh two weeks. We started with um uh a story mapping [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:16.680]   And all three of you guys are pretty familiar with the story mapping process. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:38.100]   Yeah. Excuse me. And so I remember we had like four hours of time set aside for it and we're done in two. It just wasn't that it's just not that big of a system. And two hours was enough time for us to know what all the things were. I remember the [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:36:07.380]   identified like here's here's what I'd love to do in two weeks and here's some other stuff that I don't think we'll get to that would be really cool. Um and so I think our first goal was like we wanna see something actually working and deployed in a day. And I remember that was one of the like one of the experiments, one of the like hypotheses is like we could do that. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:21.020]   Tim Tim has talked about doing a discovery session where we sit down and we talk through them with it and then we five code up something that we push to push to a production instance the same day. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:47.060]   Yeah. Yeah. And so I think Dustin couldn't get together again for a couple days so he gave us like a little bit longer than strictly you know a day but it wasn't much more than eight hours and we had like several stories you know that we'd um implemented and looked sorta live for you and deployed to fly. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:37:09.380]   So the discovery process that you guys did that was two hours, you described it as it was a story mapping but, Dustin came with the spreadsheet already there. Like to what degree did you actually write on posted notes and to what degree did Dustin explain the spreadsheet and Katie took notes or like what was that two hours and what made that two hours so effective? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:25.460]   the spreadsheet, um asking lots of questions, Katie taking amazing notes on post-it notes as you described and then following up with capturing that all in FAVR. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:39.600]   So it took those post-it Ca Katie took let me talk more clearly. Katie took notes on post-it notes in kind of a story map kind of fashion converted, those into cards in FAVR are [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:52.800]   Yeah, and I don't think she did the FAVR like she did that after we'd gotten together. So we came away out of that with our typical like here's a bunch of post-it notes that just described in our system. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   to like build I I was often working ahead of her because I could crank up the screens really really fast with with cursor and even just sometimes ju just uh a lot of it was crud screens, so I could just use the Phoenix Live U_ scaffolding to start with. Um so I did a lot of that. I had a lot of working screens in place before she had a chance to even do any wire framing or design. So she
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:52.840]   doing a lot of like yeah and I remember this was kinda stressful. She did a lot of like here's a bunch of screens deployed to fly, let's like make 'em not s be so terrible. And I think she did a lot of that. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.440]   What was that process like? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   Um she so I know a lot of it was like she was also um she was also trying out cursor for the first time. And um she wasn't like she had not done a lot of tailwind and Phoenix is like all about tailwind these days. And so she was doing a lot of like working with cursor to say like here's what I wanna do and then I don't know how to tailwind to do it in tailwind, please help. And it was doing a
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:37.200]   of like the mark-up and C_S_S_ generation for her. And and the other thing that we did um I think this was the first time I tried this is like
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:40:06.020]   Oh no, I'm a liar 'cause we did this on Paramount now that I'm thinking about it. But like one of the things that we uh tried that that was super interesting was like she would do like a hand-drawn sketch of a screen, you know I, had a screen working, but it was like obviously like really garbage design user interface-wise and terrible. And so she'd be like well, I think it should be like this. And she'd hand-draw something on her iPad. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:29.800]   She's really good at sketching. And she's really good at building an intuitive user interface. So she would sketch this much better, more usable interface for the crap that I had done. And then I'd just take an image of it and I in cursor I would like say like here's the image, can you make the screen look like this? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:37.500]   Chat window. And say here's the sc here's the code, here's this image, make the the screen look like this. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:56.420]   Make the screen look like this please. And it did it I. get one shot at it I think um with T_O_ and then C_S_S_ and it was you know very much close enough you, know there, were some small tweaks maybe, but it was like s amazingly close. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:02.220]   I probably wanna talk to Katie about this directly, but do you remember like what her impressions were of this? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:17.040]   Yeah, she was pretty blown away. I think along yeah, using using cursor and tail one together I remember she was um I 'cause I didn't know how that would go. And she was reporting really positive results from that too. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.940]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:48.060]   But the goal was to like take it a step further and pr and and use the same discovery design process to produce working software. And her being able to use her skill set of synthesizing designing and sketching and handing that to cursor and have it do the mark-up is pretty remarkable. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:03.300]   So what was the in what was the end of that story You? had two weeks, you had a spreadsheet, a bunch of cards. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:26.020]   And he had like almost no notes. Um [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.180]   notes, meaning feedback, where this isn't what I wanted. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:58.820]   Yeah. Yeah. There was definitely some like we as we implemented the thing I remember one of the things was like because we were shipping things so fast, one of the struggles was like getting enough of his time to go is this right or not. Because we had so much to show him so quickly that like I remember at one point going like oh man, uh Dustin can't get me on his calendar 'til tomorrow.
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:13.520]   I really need this answer today because two weeks is a short time frame as you know. And so one of the things that was really interesting to me about this process is like and this probably isn't a surprise we've seen this before. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:45.160]   This reminds me uh this reminds me of of extreme programming. One of the tenants of X_P_ is on-site customer. And we're going back we're going back to the basics and saying these things matter more because of A_I_ programming. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:22.380]   Oh that's really insightful. Yeah. Yeah and that's that's it what the third instance of that where we've gone like oh f turns out good practices in software development matter more now. So test driven development big, deal matters even more. On-site customer matters even more. I don't know what are all of the other things. I do the simplest. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:45.220]   Is I tell I ask cursor to say what documentation do we need for this code that we just wrote. And it generates a document and I review it and refine it and then I commit that document with my code. And that serves as a foundation for the next time we've worked together. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:45:01.080]   Yeah. I don't know, man. I haven't done that as much. So in my mind the jury's still out on like the thing that I worry about is like cursor being about as good as the average human developer about like reading and paying attention to documentation, which is not very good. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:17.620]   Yeah. And maybe it's just you know long-term memory and yeah maybe I haven't done that as much I guess I. guess. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:31.680]   Okay so we did the A_M_P_ project and if if I remember correctly you'll actually like finish it a couple days early. Uh two week engagement you, did everything that he wanted, everything that he said it wouldn't be nice to have that I don't think you're gonna get to, and you finished a couple days early. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.480]   I think that might be right, yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:53.960]   The follow-on was, and I'll talk to Tim about this, was uh basically pair programming with Tim and Dustin where it was Dustin set aside three half days and they did three like four hour sessions for the two of them to like sit down and just like live code things together. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:59.060]   Oh yeah, yeah. And that was on a different project. Yeah, I was on a different project. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:21.260]   Well of like let's intensify the customer developer engagement to try to turn things around faster, which is like a learning from your yours. Okay, so you did that A_M_P_ project that was wildly successful from our perspective. Um and then where did you go what did you do next What? was the next project that you did? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.760]   note between that and Mike Albert. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.400]   You jumped on Parker Dewey for a little while. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.400]   Yeah, but I wasn't doing much
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:42.100]   And maybe I should have, but I wasn't doing much cursor A_I_ stuff that I remember on that one. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:47:14.140]   I think if I'm trying to like I could pull it up and look here, like what did your time sheets look like for that time period that was like uh March and April ish, right? And you did P_R_ three sixty work. You did um Parker Dewey work. You did Paramount Lans more Paramount landscaping work Um. I don't I'm not sure like I feel like you did something
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:25.000]   else. 'Cause I feel like you had another experience doing A_I_ development before you went to Mike Albert. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.620]   Man. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.640]   Give me just a second here. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.140]   Okay.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:55.940]   White sheets patient, reach uh Mike Albert.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.760]   E_M_
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:04.100]   Conference prep.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:09.060]   Add some P_T_O_ in there.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.620]   White sheets.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.340]   White sheets.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:20.120]   White sheets.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:25.860]   White sheets P_T_O_.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:35.520]   Okay, let's just jump in with Mike Albert. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.100]   Sure Um.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:43.220]   Mike Albert started
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:48.660]   I don't know how convers I don't know how Tim started that conversation with them.
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:53.420]   But it was essentially like they
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:57.980]   they came to us um
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.440]   just to try to understand like
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:08.780]   how you know wanting to understand like what's worked about how we've applied
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.420]   A_I_ to
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.220]   make software development go faster for real. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:34.760]   Some of Tim's successes and Tim gets really excited about it and is like look at all these look at these things that I've done and he tells these little stories and it's like whoa that's crazy. And I think Brian was like I wanna know more about what you're doing that is so wildly successful with A_I_ do driven development. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Yeah. Yeah. And um so yeah, we had an initial conversation and basically the they have a giant project to replace a um E_R_P_ system that's using obsolete technology, Oracle form specifically, uh and they are gradually
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.800]   it in the c over the course of they have a schedule of of many years. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.640]   There are like three or four hundred of these forms that have to be converted. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:27.000]   Yeah. Yeah. And so um they are um they're replacing these one by one. They're saying that each one takes about four to six weeks. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:44.300]   Hand coding, hand testing, and de you know, it's it and deploying and all that. Just the process from I'm gonna start this form 'til it gets into their new production environment, hand coding it is four weeks plus or minus. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.060]   Yeah. So um [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:51.000]   Times three hundred forms is a ridiculous amount of time. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:51:20.900]   Yeah. So basically you know we we started with like you know an experiment to see how I I think what we kinda thought was like okay we've seen cursor take existing scr take like even just screen shots and produce you know decent H_J_M_L_C_S_S_ as a result of it. You know.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:51.360]   could we start with something like that? What if we took like just screen shots of these oracle forms and basically use that as a, you know, prompt to cursor to say like can you how much of the screen can you build essentially? Um and could we make the process of converting these screens to their new technology environment, which is not one that we're all th I have a little bit of experience with but, it's not like
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:52:21.100]   usual go-to stack at all. Which was interesting. Yeah. No content. I've done c so the the stack that they've chosen is react on the front-end and go micro-service assessment on the back-end. So it's a pretty complex environment. Not necessarily our chosen tech stack to go really really fast, right. We'd choose something else if we wanted to get something done as fast as we possibly could. Um but [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:38.060]   Uh so yeah, the experiment was like how y how can we leverage cursor to build these screens for them faster. Um and we just like said like let's try let's see what we can do in four weeks. And so [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:47.520]   Op open-ended the statement of work was incredibly vague that just said we're gonna try to figure out how to use A_I_ tooling to make their teams better and here's four weeks. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:53:05.160]   Yeah. Yeah. And it's really like yeah, to to come up with a way so that their team could could we figure out how to do it and you know show their team what we did and then help them go away and let them go faster, something like that, right? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:35.240]   Yeah. So that first four wee that first four calendar weeks you had some P_T_O_, the the manager that you were working with also had P_T_O_ and uh did not get a full four weeks' worth of work out of those calendar weeks because of reasons. And and you were kind of in making up what how am I gonna make this work. And so maybe just talk about your thought process of how you started this and how what
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.940]   what how you evolved to get to where you are now. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.780]   Yeah Um.
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:54:11.060]   So yeah, the first week or so um, I got together with um the the manager of the team once. Didn't even get a chance to get together with the rest of the dev team at all. Um but what he did have for me was a a repo of all of the Oracle form source code for all these hundreds of
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:14.140]   um s exported as X_M_L_. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.640]   Of course X_M_L_. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:36.080]   Oh my goodness. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:55:15.600]   separate files from this X_M_L_ 'cause this is garbage. And it did fine I. think it did a first version in Bash and then uh it chose Python for the next I literally didn't care at all, I just wanted a script to do it. I have no a desire to read or maintain the source code, it's like totally utility, don't care. Throw away utility. Um and no. Yeah, I test-drive run. And it [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:46.220]   did it. Like it did a reasonable job. Uh and so I had the P_L_S_ equal and that was like not that helpful 'cause like I know P_L_S_ equal, I used to write P_L_S_ equal twenty years ago. Um so it's not that I don't know that language but like reading that without the context of the rest of everything and no images of the oracle form by the way. No screenshots. I did [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:56:03.260]   think eventually yeah, no, that's eventually I did get access to the running Oracle form system and I was able to look at screens that way. But that was that I think took a few days to even get to. What I started with was was just the X_M_L_.
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:34.340]   And then after I did that script, I I said hey cursor, here's an Oracle form in this directory. Could you produce an H_T_M_L_C_S_S_ version of this screen? And it did. With nothing else, no context, no screen shot, just look at this Oracle form, it looked at the X_M_L_, it got enough information about the screen from that X_M_L_ that it actually
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:42.220]   uh a surprisingly decent H_T_M_L_C_S_S_ version of the screen, and I did that a couple times. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:49.700]   And when you saw the H_T_M_L_ that it generated and you finally got access to the form view itself, how close were they? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.340]   Um
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   Honestly, I don't remember whether I thi I I'm trying to remember a specific instance of doing that experiment. Um in some ways the the Oracle forms user interface is so poor that the H_M_L_C_S_S_ versions were better, they made more sense, they're more intuitive. But it got um it got enough done that I was like oh no it, can actually understand just from the
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:53.900]   and just from just from what it was able to learn from the X_M_L_ import, it was able to figure out enough to be useful. That's really what I wanted to know. And that was a clear yes. And then at that point I started um looking at the existing um screens that it had and I'm sorry. So they they had like several f screens implemented already ported [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.480]   That they've done by hand. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:23.800]   by hand. And so my next step was like let's you know um basically go into one of the go start going into the source code repost for the front-end and back-end and saying like okay here's a screen that they've done by hand. Here's a screen that we have identified that we have an X_M_L_ export. Using one of the existing screens as a model can you replace this oracle form? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:54.660]   and you know asking him to do things like okay well one of the things that we started with was like they they didn't really have a lot very few unit tests very very few automated tests to be honest of either the front end or the back end. And I I already knew that like that's a key for helping helping the A_I_ do a better job and go faster. So um but even with those constraints um it
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:59:08.760]   was able to like we were able to get a a screen in like a day or two. We were able to do a working version of one of the screens they identified that they wanted us to target for replacement. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.740]   And was that deployed to production? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:40.920]   No. No. But it was working in um it was working against their real database, so like a deployed environment in the sense like the back end, because this database is so giant, it's not like you can run the entire oracle database on your laptop, you have to run it against their deployed Q_A_ environment. And we were able to get in a couple days I was able to get in a couple
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:52.040]   is a working back-end microservice and a working front-end in React that actually interacted with their Real QA database. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.400]   W what's kept that from going to production? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.160]   Um
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.440]   a lot of it is like
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:07.720]   architecture decisions. So um
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:14.400]   as we've gone along, like so, one of the first things that y as we built this process, like
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:34.880]   one of the things I saw was Cursor did a really good job at like generating the back-end microservice and generating the front-end. Like it did those two things based on the R_C_L_ screen. But with their existing um application architecture
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.680]   there was as yet no um
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:47.660]   no specification, you know, no um
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:01:19.940]   nothing you n no contract between the front-end and the back-end. And essentially it was just like an arbitrary chunk of JSON being passed and with no like schema definition about what's in that JSON. So because it was like an un-specified non-standard format for the payload between the front-end and the back-end, I could get cursor to generate the screens on both sides, but
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:49.940]   of us knew whether it was right except by trial and error. So like I'd spend a couple hours whatever, you know, genera uh generating the code was really fast. But then we'd spend like two days trying to see w n trial and error to get it right and figure out like what mistake we'd made in terms of like the payload being wrong on one side or the other. You know, things like oh, we'll a guest camel case for the field on one side and and
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:02:19.720]   um uh whatever, you know, snake case on the other. Um just stupid stuff. And so um I realise like the way to actually like if you have three hundred screens to do, if you can eliminate that guess work, like that's the biggest cost savings you can get, right? Because all of a sudden like you won't have to guess anymore. So that led me to like we need to change the architecture of this system. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:20.240]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:50.300]   and I introduced open A_P_I_ that's like the go-to standard for if you're doing microservices, even if you're doing REST A_P_I_s here to how to specify them. So I basically like did the whole thing again and started with like hey cursor, before you do anything else I would like you to generate an open A_P_I_ document to describe the A_P_I_ that you need to implement this oracle for. And then I grabbed one of the other things that I
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.060]   learned from my experiments. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:03:00.600]   So hang on a second I'm, not very good enough to open A_ A_P_I_. Is it really just a specification language? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:17.380]   Yeah, that's it. It's in YAML or J_S_ON_ it's just specifying here are all the end points, here are all the payloads and parameters, and all the structure and fields and types of everything. That's it. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.880]   Uh I'm gonna have to probably get some water if I'm gonna keep going. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:35.060]   Yeah, let's I I do wanna I mean we're an hour in, let's take a little break and get some water. Uh is it st oh it is stand-up time. No, my watch says eleven thirty six. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:47.760]   Okay.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.800]   Okay.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.800]   Okay.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.800]   Okay.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.800]   Okay.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:57.380]   Okay. Thanks to our sponsors, we're back. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:19.140]   Um this is your current project, and I do wanna try to get to we're close to the end here of trying to get to um where what you've tried. I wanna focus really on like what have you tried and what it works well. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.520]   Yeah um, [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:29.940]   So you generated a form and uh it it worked, and it was a little messy. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:47.980]   Mm-hmm.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:07:04.480]   Wasn't really conducive to um it it was almost like the same thing that we learned earlier, like all of the things that we know
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:22.400]   will let us do software development well are more important now. Yeah. And it was just another thing that we learned. What we learned was like their design had s their existing design had some issues.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:29.200]   And the first one was like there was no there was no agreed-upon contract between the front and back end. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:36.260]   And so you went into open A_P_I_ and you're able to essentially just capture what it should be. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:42.700]   Mm-hmm.
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:54.540]   If there is a
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:08:07.240]   If there's an old-school code generator that's like you know um that will do what you want, like you have two options now, you can say like
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:38.480]   light live user perfect example. I think this is where I saw this. You know, I could tell cursor like, I want a new screen to create, retrieve, and update and delete products, and a product has a name and a description, whatever. I could tell it to do that. And it will generate a bunch of code, it will generate maybe a decent migration
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:09:02.520]   the live view and most of it, and it it'll be write-ish, and then there'll be some non-mistakes. If I on the command line go mix P_H_X_ dot gen products with the arguments, it will one hundred percent predictably do the same thing and be exactly correct. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:08.460]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:28.180]   doing using the generators and using cursor. Uh another example of that is uh generating migrations in Rails. It will m it will generate the migration, and the hilarious thing is it generates the file name with what looks reasonable. It it it tripped me up at first. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:36.480]   Yes.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:48.480]   It's an implicit understanding of what has to happen there that it didn't know. It just says look at this random number on the beginning of these things. I can make up a random number. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.140]   Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:41.460]   And so I had already learned that lesson. So when I got to open A_P_I_, I got to apply it again. Because guess what, there are just bazillions of deterministic code generators based on the open A_P_I_ spec. So there were seventeen d whatever. There were uh umpteen of them to choose from and go and and react. So the first thing I did was a survey of that landscape and I used
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:11:04.700]   old-school go code generator to generate all of the stubs for the open A_P_I_ rest endpoints. And then I told cursor, okay, based on the logic in this oracle form implement, this stub. And we could do that. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.020]   Did you use cursor to generate the open A_P_I_? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:38.240]   I used cursor to generate the open A_P_I_ specification document. I used go open A_P_I_ code gen to generate all of the go all of the boilerplate go code to handle those H_T_T_P_ requests and responses. And basically it it has a certain structure where it's like okay, and here's a stub for you to actually like return the data structure however you get it. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:38.780]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:56.780]   I'll take care of just bundling it up into JSON and doing all the H_T_P_ stuff, but you got this little function implement. And essentially I told cursor like okay, look at the oracle form logic, figure out what it's doing and fill in this stub and write me some tests and do the things that I need you to do. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:23.500]   Where it really got magic. It it was already quite good at following one of the React screens and building another front-end from an oracle form following their pattern. It was actually excellent at that. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:30.780]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:48.480]   the JavaScript open A_P_I_ code generator to generate the client to generate the REST client. And then I said like I got the REST client, I need you to fill i I need you to make a screen based on this oracle form and use this REST client.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:13:02.080]   And it just worked. And then I went and implemented the f the back-end a little bit more and then went back and on the front-end and click-tested it and it worked the first time. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:16.020]   The first time. Because there's no guessing. There is no guessing It. had a specification and it knew exactly what the fields were because there was a contract. Yep. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:26.200]   in and giving it pretty clear guidelines and guardrails and it performs beautifully. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:42.980]   Yeah If. you give it a s a sandbox where it can't yeah, wha a sandbox with enough walls that it can't start flinging the sand over the slide. Yes exactly, the same. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:14:16.260]   of just saying write me arbitrary code. Okay, so now you have generated the stub, you have the open A_P_I_ specification, you generated the go stubs on the backside, you used cursor to fill in the the lo the back-end logic, you used the Java script generator to generate the front-end REST client, you used cursor to uh uh determine from the oracle form X_M_L_ what goes in the react component,
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:23.820]   and, and it works. What is that where you are now? Or like it's uh [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:46.240]   Mm-hmm.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:15:00.860]   writing out and implementing and solving. But essentially like once I figured out the open A_P_I_, the next time I got together with them in person we took another screen and went through it front to back in four hours or something. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:06.120]   Yes. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.740]   What was that process like? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:38.160]   Uh we I've done it at least three, maybe four times. The first time we we did it before I'd tried the open A_P_I_ experiment. And predictably I think we got through the back-end A_P_I_ and then I had to build a front-end screen. But I was like and at this point the next thing I'm gonna do is spend about X_ hours trying to get the front-end and back-end to match up. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:38.720]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:50.640]   You guys wanna sit here and do that? Would that be fun? And I was like I wonder if we should try out open A_P_I_, and basically we agreed as a group that like the next thing I was gonna do is research open A_P_I_ to see if that would work. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:16:14.240]   So you did the first form by yourself, you troubleshooted all the the interchange problems and you're like hey I got it to work and let's get together and and showed it to them and then live-coded another one and generated the same mess and said rather than fix this let's look at open A_P_I_ and see what that'll do. So you went away and did that and then so th what's the next time you did the MOB programming? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:30.220]   an A_P_I_ and at that point we got the f full screen working in the four hours we had or six hours or something like that a day or less. There's no time to do that. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:41.800]   Like what what was their skill level in terms of like experience with [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:49.740]   Um the people that were more activa active participants were I think more s more senior level I would say. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:54.940]   And they were developers. They were f very familiar with oracle forms. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.720]   MOB, you've got a projector. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:19.880]   Yeah we, had basically had a big monitor you, know big, wall size monitor and then you could just yep. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:25.940]   How did that work? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:31.340]   It was largely me driving and talking about what I'm doing the first couple of times.
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:50.980]   Here in this more recent session one of their devs was doing most all of the driving. And uh prompting cursor and getting stuck and figuring stuff out and [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:18:01.440]   So
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:21.460]   w the thing that we're talking about doing next is saying now that we have the success of using open A_P_I_, the generators on both sides, cursor to fill in the blanks, these uh oracle form X_M_L_ documents, can we scale this up and [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:26.780]   Eat the whole elephant. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:41.140]   to build these screens fast, can we start doing like how fast can we get let's like I wanna get one of these all the way into production, m knock all knock all the find where all the things we don't know yet are. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:53.900]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:15.180]   But one of the things we've talked about is like there are some fairly significant number of relatively simple screens. Could we just start knocking these out, you know. It seems like very doable to me. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:38.220]   T_ like it it seems almost like a a conservative estimate in terms of giving us feel like it gives us plenty of time to say like we can do one of these a week no, problem Like. that feels very simple. Yeah, instead of four to six. And that's interestingly I think that's what we have observed fairly consistently is
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:20:06.260]   when you're adopting these practices of leveraging A_I_ effectively on your team, you can probably go four times as fast. Like I I think I'm at the point now where yeah, I feel like I'm saying the quiet part out loud, but if you're not going twice as fast yet since adopting these, you probably have a really big opportunity to do something better.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:15.400]   Like you should be going at least twice as fast unless there's frankly something that I just don't understand yet in the way. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:24.240]   Yeah, I think the thing that we're still trying to figure out, and that four times as fast, that feels like my own experience as well. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:55.740]   And interestingly, w and I forgot to mention this, when we did the A_ and P_ project, like we know we we have a pretty solid routine for here's how we estimate projects. And typically like we just count the number of cards, we put a reasonable n estimate of like how many cards does an a does a team tend to average doing a week. And then we just do math to come up with an estimate. And that number is typically f
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:19.560]   or five cards a week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So in two weeks that would be about ten cards. We shipped forty cards in two weeks. Yeah. So so it was four Yeah. It w we measured it and like it's yeah, go ahead. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:24.260]   Mm-hmm.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.900]   Well the th yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:56.260]   Here's what I saw on the projects that I've done so far is, you need a big enough time block, two weeks is plenty, to average out the times when it gives you like ten or you know ten or more X_ and the times when it just makes a complete mess and you need to code it yourself. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:59.300]   Mm-hmm. Oh. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:04.080]   The four X_ is an average. You need to average. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:10.420]   normal pace and the bot at ten X_ but, in the best case scenario. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:45.500]   like I I think we haven't even talked about this yet, trying to figure out when it's time to like tell cursor to move. Move. When is it time to grab the keyboard? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:23:00.760]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:15.340]   Well, not that it wants me to use more tokens, but it's like if there are a hundred developers using cursor, and cursor has this massive server farm,
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:47.300]   maybe that's why everything goes smoothly. And then one day, because it's Tuesday, there's ten thousand developers using cursor, and now their server farm can't handle that load, and the response times are slower and they're worse and it's just a bad time, it cou it could be like a relationship between how many people are using cursor at the same time, how complex your code base is,
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:24:06.800]   and like what are the context and parameters that you're managing locally that's combined with what everybody else is doing, that's combined with we just released a new version of the L_L_M_ that still isn't quite tweaked right. And so it's like there's it is very non-deterministic what you're gonna get out of cursor on any given day. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:18.840]   Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:51.920]   Here's a garbage wad for you. You know, like it it will spectacularly fail some substantial portion of the time and just got a deal. That's how it is. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:25:07.520]   Alright. Here's my last question. Based on all of this experience, oh the other thing that you're doing, this may not be my last question, is you're going into freight. Just talk about what you're doing there at freight. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.280]   Yeah, 'cause I'm not there. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.820]   I understand that. But what are you anticipating What? have we sold them? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:30.960]   We have sold them um a workshop where we're going to essentially like mob program with their team for a couple four hour sessions and have some amount of like preparation time to get ready to do that. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:36.980]   So you're going to one, freight's a previous client. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:45.460]   It's somewhat t familiar with the domain. You wrote the b the lion's share of their back-end. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:49.460]   I built yeah, yeah, I. love the team that built the first version of what they have, yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:26:03.880]   And that was several years ago. We don't know all the ways in which it's evolved since then. They've had developers working on it. But you're you're familiar with the domain, you're familiar with the code base, but you're gonna spend time to understand where they are now. Uh-huh. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:34.360]   They've identified a thing that they would like to leverage A_I_ to build. I don't know what the thing is, it's specific feature they have in mind. I'm gonna get with their lead dev Elijah to understand what it is they're wanting to do, get a feel for what the code base is like now. Uh like you said, it's you know, it's elixir and I'm very familiar with the original version of it certainly. Um but I don't know how it's changed or what's different now. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:37.680]   So I'm gonna get as much information as I can to get ready for that. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:51.500]   So that's like a discovery session. And uh not uh let me just pair with Elijah on the thing. It's really a discovery let's, just talk about this kind of thing. So once you're w [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:33.820]   hold the keyboard you're, gonna talk about what you're doing. And what I have no idea is like what's interesting about the Mike Albert project is they clearly have a repeatable problem where like if we can get this really fast for for w for one of these we, know there's a factor of hundreds that we can multiply by. I have no [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:46.740]   idea what if that situation exists at freight at all. And I have no idea like you know I I am still confident that like just by applying [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:28:11.220]   L_L_L_M_s effectively even on existing code base there's some like that's why I go like you know we've observed four X_ but I think if we back off and say conservatively I think two X_ is a reasonable expectation for like you know leveraging these things on an existing code base we still should be able to go quite a bit faster than we were without them. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:41.640]   there's a there's a mind shift. For me personally, I was very skeptical uh and I've I've jokingly said this, I really hoped that A_I_ would just like be a hype train that would blow over and I could retire before I had to deal with it. And that's obviously not the case. And I was I was skeptical, I didn't wanna use it, but when I saw it being effectively demonstrated, I was like oh, and then I started doing it and I was
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:29:11.640]   I probably am not gonna hand code things anymore. Like why would I? Like this T_D_M_ is handled for me and I can tell it what to do. So I think that like this workshop, even if what they're doing is not repeatable, you can help their developers, if they have not yet already had it, have that mind shift that says oh, now I see what I what you're doing. Now I can go back to my desk and I can use this and do something that is two X_ And. I think that's part of
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:40.840]   we're trying to experiment with as well. It's I don't think it's like it it is a p almost a binary thing of somebody and I've seen this in other organisations when I've talked to them. I haven't like actually seen the light bulb turn on. But you talk to them and they're like oh yeah our, junior developers are out there playing with this and our senior developers are are holding at arm's length saying I don't wanna do this. And if there's some way to demonstrate to the senior developers the value of what we're doing [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:41.180]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.560]   as another senior developer, it it can flip that light switch. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:30:11.220]   Yeah. Now I know exactly what you're talking about. I I I wish I'd thought to mention this in my early experiments. I think my early experiments yeah, there was a period of time where like yeah, co-pilot was the thing and it just wasn't very good yet. But I think there was also a period of time where it probably was good, and I think this was where Mike was right and I was wrong. There's it probably was good.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:41.600]   enough to be useful, but I didn't want it to be. Because absolutely one hundred percent like it still scares the heck out of me. But it scared the heck out of me more then because I believe that like it's gonna be replacing me and it's gonna be generating garbage that works ish and that's all anybody cares about and the whole field of programming is gonna go down the toilet then with the [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:42.880]   am I gonna do with my life? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:49.820]   This existential crisis of am I being replaced by A_I_ and to what degree and [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:27.240]   whoo-hoo I. I am only going with my life. Yes. One hundred percent. Um and it took me like really you know a couple ti even after Tim was like hey you know we're doing pretty good work over here, it took me two more tries to go like oh okay. And then yeah, I think it was a real one where I was like oh wait wait no, actually like writing c it
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:51.720]   it can help you write good code. It can help you you can help it by giving it to us. Like there is this yeah, there is some there is some thing that happened where I realized it was it was a tool that could help me do a really good work and not a thing that was gonna replace me. That's it. It's a tool that's you know, it's we're going to be augmented by it. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:56.580]   Yeah. Yeah, we are. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:32:06.700]   the A_I_ bot did this thing. I think I did this thing Um. and and I think the statement of work from Mike Albert actually says [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:16.040]   Yeah. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:49.980]   And we think we could say, you know what, by the way, just give us all this work 'cause we can automate it and let your developers go do other things that are more important. It's almost the same thing with freight. We're just trying to facilitate that transition to make that transition happen smoother, better for these other organisations that will probably have these transitions anyway, right. There's no way that we're gonna get to twenty twenty six and m there's not
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:52.280]   gonna be more organisations using these tools. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:33:03.540]   I think there are. But I also think like, you know, and it uh I've gone to conferences where like people make this point really well, it's like we're
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:31.940]   we're like soaking in this thing like you know we're like the frog in the pot and we we feel the there's some aspect of like the outside there's a huge outside world that doesn't that isn't yet seeing what we're seeing and humans move really slowly. I think there's gonna be a huge percentage of software development that
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:47.000]   is gonna take a long time to adopt this stuff and I think there's gonna be opportunity for a long time to like help or get like the A_I_ moves really really fast, but humans move really really slow. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:59.100]   That that reminds me of the old joke about when the world ends I wanna be in Cincinnati 'cause everything happens ten years later there. Okay, so that leads me into my actual last question. And then we'll be done. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:03.420]   Okay.
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:16.820]   context that we've just now rehashed, which has been actually very enjoyable for me. What do you think is like immediately next for us as an organisation? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:41.960]   I think there are a couple things that I'm most bullish about. I do feel like there's an opportunity to help organisations apply this stuff to to augment their developers with A_I_ to help them make that mindset shift, to help them understand that nah there's not
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:35:12.460]   a scenario that I can envision that they're really being replaced. There's just like this opportunity for them all to become superhero developers. Um how do we help more organisations do that, more people do that. I think there's opportunities there that I'm excited about. Uh I also think there's opportunities for more organisations like Paramount that never would have been able to afford custom software development for being able to [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:18.720]   it from custom software development if we can lower the cost by a factor of ten. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.300]   The democratisation of custom software. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:40.100]   Yeah. And then I also think there's like a huge amount of legacy systems that it you know need to be replaced, everybody knows it, everybody hates him, everybody wants to do it, but it's been like insanely cost prohibitive, and now it's not. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:45.360]   The barrier to entry was just like it was a non-starter. And now it's not. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.000]   Yeah. Yeah. So those are the three things I can think of off the top of my head. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:36:20.600]   Tim has said and I I like this word because he likes to use it so much bespoke bespoke E_R_P_s that helping maybe not small people like small companies I shouldn't say small people I'm sorry small businesses like there's an I there's a way to build very very very focus software for like Paramount okay, great. But I'm I'm talking more like the A_M_P_s like that mid the the true mid-range who are
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:42.360]   on the cusp of needing an E_R_P_, but don't. So instead of investing all the mon I mean how much money has Mike Albert spent on Oracle over the years? I mean they've been doing that Oracle for fifteen twenty years. It's it's gotta be hundreds of millions of dollars that they spent on it. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.540]   Hundreds of thousands, I hope it's not hundreds of millions of but anyway. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:58.640]   Yeah, I'm bad at my orders of magnitude. I'm just thinking like what is their licensing fees across twenty years plus all the co all the the consultants that they've paid to work on it over the years. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:09.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:24.260]   Yeah. Yep. And I'm also excited about that space as well. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:42.560]   Okay. Uh we've been at this conversation for a long time Uh. an hour and thirty seven minutes. Uh I wanna give you the last word. What do you want to wrap us up with? [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:38:02.540]   I have no idea. I was gonna try to come up with some really long word. Dermatologists. Alright. Thank you Chris. Thank you for s giving me two hours of your time. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:21.280]   Yeah it was fun. Uh definitely looking forward to the transcript also. I'm going to feed this to an A_I_ tool and say please generate a slide deck for a talk based on this and see what happens when I'm percent gonna do that. Bye.

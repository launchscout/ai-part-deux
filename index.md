# My own experience
- It's scary
- We've been rooting for it to fail
- But if we can push past that
- It's exhilirating

---

# Agenda
- Where are we now?
  - some odd things you might be seeing
- What do?
- What are the opportunities?
- Where *might* we be headed?

---

# How did ~~we~~ I get here?
- Very experienced developer
- Hardcore AI skeptic Enthusiastic AI adopter

---

# You might be seeing this
- Junior devs *loving* their AI coding tools
- Senior devs telling you it's all garbage

---

# Junior devs
- Can make more progress than ever before
- Less memorization of obscure technical details
- In some cases, may not know what they don't know
- May not yet understand the *why* behind best practices

---

# Senior devs: Let's talk about the quiet part out loud
- We've been rooting for AI to fail
- It's scary!
- It looks like everything we love about our career is ending
  - No one will care about good code
  - No one will care about good practices

---

# None of this is true!
- Ok, maybe the scary part is
- AI is not failing
- Everything that makes us good at software development matters even more now!

---

# AI is a force multiplier
- Everything we do it can help us do faster
- We can build great software quickly!
- **OR***
- We can make a giant mess!

---

# Generating code isn't enough
- "as well as a human" isn't enough
- Humans aren't that good at it either!

---

# How do **we** get better at writing code?

---

# Improving the feedback loop

---

# More context

---

# Stumbling blocks
- Not trying it
- Giving up too soon
- Waiting too long to give up

---

# Techniques

---

# TDD

---

# More context

---

# Don't make it write all the code

---

# Less guessing

---

# Documentation helps... to a point

---

# The human experience

---

# This sh*t is scary

---

# A typical senior dev experience
## Can it really replace me?
- Let's try it
- Oooh that was amazing
- Let's give it something a little harder
- Hah! It failed
- *Phew*

---

# A lot of us have been asking the wrong question
## Can it augment us?

---

# New possibilities
## I hate to make predictions, particularly about the future..

---

# Projects that benefit the most
- Legacy rewrites
- Stuff like beyondwill screens

---

# Revisiting Buy vs Build

---

# Am I there yet?
## What to expect

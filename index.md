# Outcomes
## WebAssembly Components
- What and Why
- Building and running
- Use cases
- Future

---

# My own experience
- It's scary
- We've been rooting for it to fail
- But if we can push past that
- It's exhilirating

---

# What's worked

---

# Generating code isn't enough
- "as well as a human" isn't enough
- Humans aren't that good at it either!

---

# How do we get better?

---

# Improving the feedback loop

---

# More context

---

# Stumbling blocks
- Not trying it
- Giving up too soon
- Waiting too long to give up

---

# Techniques

---

# TDD

---

# More context

---

# Don't make it write all the code

---

# Less guessing

---

# Documentation helps... to a point

---

# The human experience

---

# This sh*t is scary

---

# A typical senior dev experience
## Can it really replace me?
- Let's try it
- Oooh that was amazing
- Let's give it something a little harder
- Hah! It failed
- *Phew*

---

# A lot of us have been asking the wrong question
## Can it augment us?

---

# New possibilities
## I hate to make predictions, particularly about the future..

---

# Projects that benefit the most
- Legacy rewrites
- Stuff like beyondwill screens

---

# Revisiting Buy vs Build

---

# Am I there yet?
## What to expect
